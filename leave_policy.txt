UFix Ltd. Holiday Leave Policy
---------------------------------


All employees of UFix Ltd. Are entitled to 5.6 weeks of paid holidays annually.Employers can also choose to include bank holidays as part of the annual leave entitlement.However, all of this varies on what an employee’s working pattern is; 

-Working 5+ days a week: if an individual has a full-time work schedule, they are then entitled up to 28 days of paid leave (holidays). 

-Part-time work: just like full-time, part time is also entitled up to 28 days paid leave, but they will get paid less than those who work full-time. 

-Irregular work hours: an individual who works irregular hours (i.e. shifts) would have to use an entitlement calculator to see what their annual paid leave would be. 

An individual’s working pattern also effects the way they would be guaranteed holidays;

-Fixed Hours/Fixed Pay: an individual who has a fixed amount of hours and pay will equal to the pay they receive on holidays
E.g. if an individual earns £200 weekly, when taking holiday leave they will then be entitled to £200 of pay leave weekly. 

-Shift Work/Fixed Hours: an individual who has shift work with fixed hours would be entitled to what they had earned on average within the past 12 weeks. 
E.g. an individual could have a fix of 20 hours a week, but then could do overtime during the period of 12 weeks. Their average pay over that time would reflect how much they would be entitled to. 

-No Fixed Hours (e.g. 0 hour contract): an individual would get paid primarily from their average pay over the previous 12 weeks.
